Caesar Cipher Encryption Program

Description
This project is part of the Prodigy Cyber Security internship. It implements the Caesar Cipher technique in Python to encrypt text by shifting characters by a specified number of positions.

Features
- Encrypts both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Keeps non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
- Accepts user input for text and shift value.

How It Works
1. User Input: Prompts for the text to be encrypted and the shift value.
2. Encryption: Shifts characters:
   - Uppercase: Within the uppercase ASCII range.
   - Lowercase: Within the lowercase ASCII range.
   - Non-alphabetic: Remains unchanged.
3. Output: Displays the original text, shift value, and encrypted text.

Example OUTPUT:
Enter the text to be encrypted: HelloWorld
Enter the shift value: 3
Text  : HelloWorld
Shift : 3
Cipher: KhoorZruog
